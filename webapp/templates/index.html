                    In digital times, digital crimes are also rocketing. 
                    People need a way to keep themselves safe from online threats.
                    This application will warn you whenever a “threatening account” tries 
                    to interact with you. The scan function can be used in two different ways:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            You can search for a specific account and receive a full report on the account. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can enter your own Twitter handle and be given analysis of 
                            all of your followers under a selected criteria on which you choose to search, 
                            documented as a full report which highlights the dangerous users, and, if possible, 
                            will give an option to unfollow a specific user or mass unfollow all threatening accounts. 
                        </li>
