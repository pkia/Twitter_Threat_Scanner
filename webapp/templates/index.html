            In digital times, digital crimes are also rocketing. 
            People need a way to keep themselves safe from online threats.<br/> 
            This application will warn you whenever a “threatening account” tries 
            to interact with you. The scan function can be used in two different ways:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    You can search for a specific account and receive a full report on the account. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can enter your own Twitter handle and be given analysis of 
                    all of your followers under a selected criteria on which you choose to search, 
                    documented as a full report which highlights the dangerous users, and, if possible, 
                    will give an option to unfollow a specific user or mass unfollow all threatening accounts. 
                </li>
            </ul>
